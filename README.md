# EcoRoute Mobile App

This is a React Native (Expo) mobile application prototype designed to help users find eco-friendly routes. It allows users to input a start and end destination (conceptually) and view a list of mock transportation routes sorted by an eco-score.

## Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites**:

    - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
    - npm or yarn
    - Expo Go app on your mobile device (for testing on a physical device) or an Android/iOS simulator/emulator.

2.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or ensure you have the project files.

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    This will start the Metro bundler. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone or run on a simulator (e.g., by pressing `a` for Android or `i` for iOS in the terminal if a simulator is set up).

## Mock Data

- **Location**: The mock route data is stored in `assets/routes.json`.
- **Loading Method**:
  - The data is directly imported into the application using TypeScript's `resolveJsonModule` capability.
  - The `src/services/routeService.ts` file contains the `getMockRoutes` function which simulates fetching this data as if from an API, including a small artificial delay.
  - No external mock server (like `json-server`) is required to run this prototype as the data is bundled with the app.

## Design Decisions

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo was chosen for its rapid development capabilities, ease of setup, and extensive library support.
  - Expo SDK 53 is used as requested.
- **Language**: TypeScript is used for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Navigation**: `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/native-stack` are used for screen transitions and managing the navigation flow between the Input, Results, and Map Preview screens.
- **HTTP Client (Conceptual)**: Although `axios` was installed as per instructions, the current implementation directly imports the mock JSON. If a real backend were used, `axios` would be the client for making API requests. The `routeService.ts` is structured to easily accommodate such a change.
- **Maps**: `react-native-maps` is used for the bonus Map Preview screen, displaying a basic map with dummy coordinates, markers, and a polyline.
- **Project Structure**:
  ```
  /assets         # Static assets like routes.json
  /src
      /components   # Reusable UI components (currently minimal, for future expansion)
      /constants    # Application-wide constants (e.g., API keys, if any)
      /contexts     # React Context API for global state (if needed beyond simple prop drilling)
      /hooks        # Custom React hooks
      /navigation   # Navigation setup (StackNavigator)
      /screens      # Screen components (Input, Results, MapPreview)
      /services     # Logic for data fetching (e.g., routeService.ts)
      /types        # TypeScript type definitions (routes, navigation params)
      /utils        # Utility functions
  App.tsx         # Root application component integrating navigation
  index.ts        # Entry point for registering the root component
  tsconfig.json   # TypeScript configuration with path aliases for cleaner imports
  ```
- **State Management**: Primarily React component state (`useState`) is used for managing local screen states (input fields, loading, errors). For a larger application, React Context API or a dedicated state management library (like Zustand or Redux Toolkit) would be considered.
- **Styling**: React Native's `StyleSheet` API is used for styling. Efforts were made to maintain consistent spacing, typography, and ensure touch targets are adequately sized (â‰¥48x48 dp where applicable).
- **Clean Coding**: Followed principles of separation of concerns (e.g., service layer for data, distinct screen components, navigation logic) and modularity.

## Next Steps (Roadmap to Production)

To evolve EcoRoute Mobile into a production-grade application, several key areas would need development:

1.  **Real Backend Integration**: Replace the mock `routes.json` and `routeService.ts` with a robust backend API. This would involve integrating a real routing engine (e.g., Google Maps Directions API, Mapbox Directions API, or an open-source solution like OSRM) to calculate actual routes based on user input addresses. The `axios` library would be used for network requests, including comprehensive error handling, request/response interceptors for logging or auth, and cancellation.

2.  **Address Input & Geocoding**: Implement proper address input fields with autocomplete/suggestions using a geocoding service (e.g., Google Places API). This would convert user-typed addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) required by routing APIs.

3.  **Advanced Map Features**: Enhance the `MapPreviewScreen` to display the actual route polyline received from the routing API. Add turn-by-turn navigation (potentially integrating with device-native navigation apps), display of alternative routes on the map, and real-time traffic information.

4.  **State Management**: For more complex state interactions (e.g., user preferences, cached routes, global loading states), implement a more scalable state management solution like Zustand or Redux Toolkit. React Context API could be used for theming or simpler global states.

5.  **User Authentication & Profiles**: Add user accounts to save favorite routes, travel history, and personalize eco-friendly suggestions. This would involve backend support for user management and secure authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).

6.  **Enhanced UI/UX**: Refine the user interface with a professional design system, including custom icons for transport modes, animations, and transitions. Conduct UX research to optimize usability and accessibility (WCAG compliance).

7.  **Offline Support & Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed routes or map tiles to improve performance and provide limited offline functionality (e.g., using AsyncStorage or a local database like SQLite).

8.  **Testing**: Introduce comprehensive testing, including unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library) for components and services, integration tests for navigation and data flow, and end-to-end tests (Appium, Detox) to ensure overall application stability.

9.  **CI/CD & Deployment**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or EAS Build/Submit) for automated testing, building, and deploying to app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

10. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize app performance, paying attention to bundle size, startup time, and smooth map interactions.
